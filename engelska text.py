It was a late evening in October. The Johnsson family was on a cruising ship on their way to the Bahamas. Today there was a great sea and much wind. Emily and Chris from the Johnsson family were down in their cabin trying to sleep, trying to get new energy for the day tomorrow. The great waves hit the side of the ship and make a kind of rocking motion. The sound of the waves and the sea made it very peaceful down in the cabin.

The ship started to enter a more shallow depth and the waves got bigger. The boat was now swinging side to side in an aggressive motion. Suddenly the ship stopped. The waves carried the ship away in the moonshine. Chris and Emily finally got to sleep after the annoying motor sound stopped.

The following morning their mom and dad were not present in the cabin. They decided to take a walk up to the breakfast floor to take a look after them. On their way up the stairs, they saw bodies left to right, all mashed into the walls. There were blood piles almost everywhere and the smell of dead bodies started to pile up. Just then they saw that the ship was no longer in motion, it had gotten stuck in the sandbank until an island.

Chris and Emily scanned the ship after potential survivors and found none but an old lady. They together discussed the horrible situation and came up with the common thought of not panicking and trying their best to call for help was the best solution. The work distribution was:
Chris: Try to reach the captain's floor and call for help.
Emily: Begin cleaning the boat of dead bodies and cleaning up the blood.
The old lady by the name Karen: Look after the reserves of food and try to calculate how long they would survive on the onboard food.

They all met up at the end of that evening. They discussed what they had come up with. The old lady had found food for about three days. They thought it would be way more but the food was already starting to rot. Emily was still not finished with her work since it was a large task that took a long time. Chris had found the radio, however, the antenna was broken. He was thinking about using the cutlery and some tape to make an antenna. The idea was however quickly turned down since the cutlery was rust-free and thus making it non-magnetic and not capable of taking in radio waves from other radio stations.

After two days of hard labour, they had only one more meal of food left. They gathered and decided that Chris and Emily should go onto the island and try to gather berries or fruits. They first had to gather a bunch of clothes and tie them up to create a rope that could be used for climbing in and out of the cruising ship. While on the island they both discussed the scenario.
Emily proceeds to say:
Karen is right now only eating our food. We are making all the mark work.
I fully agree, said Chris and looked over to the ship.
We should get rid of her.
He said.
They planned a way to kill her. Chris grabbed a handful of sand and put it in his pocket. Emily found a long and sharp stone on the shore. After that, they both knew how it had to go down.


When the sun was about to fade and emerge with the horizon they climbed onboard. They found Karen sleeping on a sofa located in the lunch hall. Chris sneaked into the kitchen and grabbed the first sharp thing he saw, a butcher knife. Emily grabbed a bit of rope used to tie up the ends of sausages and tied up Karen's wrists and ankles. Chris walked up to the sleeping old lady and raised the knife, he hesitated, thinking of all the lives that were lost, was it worth one more to make them survive? To his surprise, Emily grabbed the knife and slit Karen's throat. A stream of blood came out and made a little puddle on the ground. Emily instantly began chopping the body up into edible pieces while Chris slowly walked up to the captain's cabin where the cleaning gear was located. He once again tried the radio. He turned on all the regulators and suddenly the radio began blinking in all different colours. He switched channels and to his surprise, he heard voices. A flood of guilt and shock hit his body. With a shivery voice, he called the coastguard. Chris remembered the body. He could leave no evidence of the murder they committed. He ran down and found Emily with her head deep down in the poor lady's chest. He uttered a few words.
-The coast guard is coming.
They dragged the body into a garbage bag and hid it underground.
The coast guard came shortly after and escorted them both to land where they later got put in a children's home. Even though no one knew what they had done, it all carried with them throughout their lives.
